# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
# This program take 2 or 3 arguments in the command line.
# The 1st argument is the python file name (i.e. fge.py)
# The 2nd argument is the path to a PNG image file, in the form of a string
# The 3rd argument is optional. If the third argument is specified as "invert", then the program will return an inverted color image, which looks like an x-ray effect.
# The return of this program is a PNG image being printed to the command line.
# Please keep in mind that larger PNG images will take a longer time to load, and may appear differently depending on the size capacity of a user's terminal.
# BEFORE RUNNING: pip install matplotlib, sty, and PIL
# USES: steganography, creating an x-ray filter, loading up a larger version of small image files, printing PNG image files in a command line Terminal.

#Import sys, os, matplotlib, sty, and PIL modules
import sys, os
from matplotlib import image as imgMPL
from sty import fg, bg, ef, rs, Style, RgbFg
from PIL import Image as pilmager
